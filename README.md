#Assignment 5: A New Branch
-Establish a proper file structure for the project with the following folders:
-Merge our cleaned dataset with a new fake dataset, and documented the merge type and any NA values created.

1. Data Folder: This folder contains the raw dataset, 2024_salarybyagegroup_data.csv, which is a fake dataset generated for merging with the clean_survey_2025-02-06_assign4_sosochoi dataset.

2. Clean_Data Folder: This folder will store the cleaned dataset, clean_survey_2025-02-06_assign4_sosochoi, which will be merged with the 2024_salarybyagegroup_data.csv dataset.

3. Scripts Folder: This folder contains two Python scripts:
-gen_fake_data.ipynb: This script generates a CSV file containing average salary data based on age groups for the year 2024.
-Assign5_Merge_dataset.ipynb: This script performs the merging of the clean_survey_2025-02-06_assign4_sosochoi dataset with the fake dataset 2024_salarybyagegroup_data.csv. It will also explain the type of merge chosen and the types of NA values created.

4. Documents Folder: This folder contains a Word document with a screenshot of the local version of the project.

5. Results Folder: This folder includes the output file "merged_student_data.csv," which is generated after executing the "Assign5_Merge_dataset.ipynb" script.
