        <h2>Project Overview</h2>
        <p>This repository reflects my learning progress, starting from Assignment 1 to the final project (Assignment 5). The goal is to showcase the development of skills in data cleaning, merging datasets, and applying what I have learned across multiple assignments.</p>
        <p>In this project, I have merged a cleaned dataset with a new fake dataset and documented the merge process, including any NA values created.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Assignment 1: Getting Started</h2>
        <p>In Assignment 1 (BABI4005Assign1.md), I focused on:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Learning the basics of GitHub (push, pull, and other fundamental concepts).</li>
            <li>Getting familiar with Jupyter notebooks and their functionality.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Assignment 4: Cleaning the Data</h2>
        <p>In Assignment 4, I learned how to clean and preprocess datasets, focusing on:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Identifying and handling missing data.</li>
            <li>Standardizing data formats.</li>
            <li>Ensuring the dataset was ready for analysis.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Assignment 5: Merging the Datasets</h2>
        <p>In Assignment 5, I applied the skills learned in previous assignments to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Merge the cleaned dataset with a fake salary dataset.</li>
            <li>Document the merge process and the NA values created during the merge.</li>
            <li>Apply data cleaning, dataset merging, and handling missing data concepts.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Final Thoughts on the Learning Progress</h2>
        <p>Each assignment built upon the skills I learned in the previous ones:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Assignment 1 helped me get familiar with GitHub and Jupyter notebooks.</li>
            <li>Assignment 4 allowed me to clean and preprocess data effectively.</li>
            <li>Assignment 5 demonstrated my ability to merge datasets and handle missing data (NA values) introduced during the merge.</li>
        </ul>
