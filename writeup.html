        <h2>Project Overview</h2>
        <p>This repository reflects my learning progress from <strong>Assignment 1</strong> to <strong>Assignment 5</strong>, showcasing the development of my skills in <strong>data cleaning</strong>, <strong>merging datasets</strong>, and applying what I have learned across multiple assignments. Below is a breakdown of each assignment and how it contributed to my learning:</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Assignment 1: Introduction to GitHub and Jupyter Notebooks</h2>
        <p>In <strong>Assignment 1</strong>, I was introduced to <strong>GitHub</strong> and <strong>Jupyter notebooks</strong>:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>GitHub</strong>: I learned how to use GitHub for version control, including how to create repositories, push and pull changes, and manage branches.</li>
            <li><strong>Jupyter Notebooks</strong>: I became familiar with Jupyter notebooks as an environment for interactive coding and documentation.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This assignment laid the foundation for managing code and data, and was my first experience with using GitHub for a project.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Assignment 4: Automating Data Cleaning with Jupyter Notebook</h2>
        <p>In <strong>Assignment 4</strong>, I used <strong>Jupyter notebooks</strong> to automate the cleaning of a <strong>student survey dataset</strong>:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>I explored the dataset to identify missing values and outliers.</li>
            <li>I applied <strong>data cleaning techniques</strong> such as handling missing values, filtering out irrelevant data, and standardizing formats.</li>
            <li>The notebook allowed me to automate the cleaning process, which made it easier to handle large datasets in a reproducible manner.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This assignment helped me develop a deeper understanding of <strong>data preprocessing</strong> and how to automate tasks using <strong>Python</strong> in Jupyter notebooks.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Assignment 5: Merging Datasets and Handling Missing Data</h2>
        <p>In <strong>Assignment 5</strong>, I applied the skills from <strong>Assignment 4</strong> to merge the <strong>cleaned student survey dataset</strong> from <strong>Assignment 4</strong> with a new fake dataset:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The fake dataset, <strong>2024 salary by age group</strong>, was generated to simulate salary data for different age groups.</li>
            <li>I merged these two datasets to create a comprehensive dataset that could be used for analysis.</li>
            <li>I documented the merging process and handled <strong>NA values</strong> that were created during the merge.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This assignment allowed me to demonstrate my ability to merge multiple datasets and manage missing data, which is a critical skill in <strong>data analysis</strong>.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>Throughout these assignments, I have built upon my knowledge and skills:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Assignment 1</strong> introduced me to <strong>GitHub</strong> and <strong>Jupyter notebooks</strong>, which are essential tools for managing projects and coding.</li>
            <li><strong>Assignment 4</strong> taught me how to clean and preprocess data using <strong>Python</strong> and <strong>Jupyter notebooks</strong>.</li>
            <li><strong>Assignment 5</strong> gave me the opportunity to apply data cleaning techniques to merge datasets and handle real-world issues like missing data.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This progression has helped me develop a strong foundation in <strong>data management</strong> and <strong>analysis</strong> that will be valuable for future projects.</p>
